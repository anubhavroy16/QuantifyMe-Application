# QuantifyMe-Application

Description: 

Built a smart investment analysis website that integrates directly with brokerage APIs (like Zerodha Kite or Upstox) to fetch a user’s live stock portfolio. The platform performs in-depth risk assessment, including expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and Value at Risk (VaR). It also offers strategic insights such as diversification analysis, sector exposure warnings, rebalancing suggestions, and benchmark comparisons against indices like NIFTY 50. Designed with a modular architecture using Python, Streamlit (or FastAPI), and real-time stock data via yFinance or broker APIs, the project bridges IT, finance, and data science.

**🔧 Core Skill Set Required**

📊 Finance & Quantitative Analysis
Portfolio Theory Basics
Expected return, standard deviation (volatility)
Sharpe ratio
Value at Risk (VaR) – parametric and historical methods
Benchmarking & Strategy
Index comparisons (NIFTY 50, Sensex)
Sectoral diversification
Portfolio rebalancing logic

🐍 Python & Data Science
Python Libraries
pandas, numpy – for data manipulation and numerical operations
scipy, statsmodels – for statistical modeling (for VaR, correlations)
matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly – for portfolio visualizations
Finance/Data APIs
yfinance – fetching historical stock data
Zerodha Kite / Upstox APIs – to fetch user portfolios (you'll need tokens, session mgmt)
requests, json – for API handling

🧱 Backend/Architecture
Streamlit (if focusing on rapid prototyping/dashboarding)
Simpler, good for MVPs
Easier UI for finance data dashboards
FastAPI (if making a scalable backend)
Modern async Python backend framework
Better for long-term production, mobile app extensions, or multiple routes
Modular Project Design
Clear separation of concerns: API handling, risk analysis, data fetching, UI

🌐 Frontend (Optional but Useful)
If using Streamlit, frontend is mostly handled
If going full-stack:
HTML/CSS + JS
React (optional)
Charting libs: Plotly.js or Highcharts

🔐 Authentication & Security (for brokerage APIs)
OAuth2 / token-based authentication
Session management
Secure storage of access tokens

🧪 Extras (for better UX & future-proofing)
Caching data to avoid re-fetching large datasets
Logging and error handling
Docker (for deployment)
Git (for version control)

🧠 Suggested Learning Priorities (If You’re Still Learning)
Python for Data Analysis → pandas, numpy, yfinance
Finance Concepts → risk metrics, portfolio optimization
API Integration → work with mock APIs first (like Zerodha Kite's sandbox)
Streamlit / FastAPI → UI/backend logic
Visualization → make insights clear and clean
